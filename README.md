# OsuKeyPresses

A simple tool to calculate hold times for osu!, osu!taiko and osu!mania replays.

> [!WARNING]
> osu!taiko support is largely untested currently, please proceed with caution.

## Usage

Download the tool from the [releases page](https://github.com/tsunyoku/OsuKeyPresses/releases/latest). Run the `.exe` file, and the UI should open.

You will need to provide osu! API credentials in order to do beatmap look ups. You can get a client ID and client secret for the API from [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#oauth). These will be persisted across sessions.

Once your credentials are stored, you can click the `Load Replay` button and navigate to the replay you'd like to analyse. Once loaded, press the `Analyse` button and you should see a graph appear.

Alternatively, **you can also drag a replay into the window**.
